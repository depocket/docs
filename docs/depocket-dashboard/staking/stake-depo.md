# How to stake DEPO token?

### ðŸš€ Staking DEPO Earns More Profit with DePocket

How does staking DEPO make you rich when combined with the strength of compound interest? Well, there are three reasons to explain why embarking on your staking journey with DePocket staking pools can be extremely profitable:


- DEPO staking is much safer than farming because it can prevent impermanent loss and slippage.
- The more people staking, the more liquidity, resulting in investors avoiding impermanent loss with slippage when staking DEPO/BUSD. It also increases decentralization to help avoid hacker attacks, improving the general security for DEPO staking and DEPO/BUSD
- As more investors stake, the percentage of profits will reduce to avoid inflation.


Letâ€™s have a look at how you can stake DEPO step by step.

3) Investors can Harvest and also clear all the information here.

4) After choosing a 7-day DEPO stake, the rewards can be claimed here.

5) Investors can also type the amount they want to stake on the left side. However, on the right side, DEPO can be unstaked before the timeline, but remember, if you do that, you cannot claim the rewards and will still incur the cost of any gas fees.

6) If you want to buy more DEPO, please click on the button `Get DEPO now`! This will take investors to PancakeSwap where they can buy more DEPO.
